# Hotel Market Segment Analysis
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

First I converted the Excel file (.xlsx) to csv, then joined them into one unified file using pandas

The notebook for this project can be opened and viewed using this [link](https://github.com/Binyoh1/Hotel-Market-Segment-Analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

In this project I aim to gain the following insights:
- What is the overall hotel market segmentation (market segment composition/distribution) and market segmentation per hotel type?
- What are the most in-demand meal packages (BB (Bed & Breakfast), HB (Half Board), FB (Full Board), SC (Self-catering), etc). Categorize this by:
  - hotel overall
  - hotel type (city or resort)
  - market segment
- Calculate hotel revenue while accounting for discount offers for each market segment
